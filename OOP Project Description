OOP Project :
âœ… What is Required?
This is a mini-project from a Python Programming Fundamentals course. The tasks are divided into labs, and you are asked to:

ðŸ”§ Create 4 Main Classes:
Person, Employee (inherits from Person), Car, Office

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives per Class:
ðŸ”¹ Person class:
-Attributes: name, money, mood, healthRate
-Methods: sleep(hours), eat(meals), buy(items)

ðŸ”¹ Employee class:
-Inherits from Person
-Attributes: id, car, email, salary, distanceToWork
-Methods: work(hours), drive(distance), refuel(gasAmount), send_mail(to, subject, body)

ðŸ”¹ Car class:
-Attributes: name, fuelRate, velocity
-Methods: run(velocity, distance), stop()
-Properties validation:
-velocity must be between 0â€“200
-fuelRate must be between 0â€“100

ðŸ”¹ Office class:
Attributes: name, employees (list)

ðŸ”¹Methods:
-get_all_employees()
-get_employee(empId)
-hire(employee)
-fire(empId)
-deduct(empId, amount)
-reward(empId, amount)
-check_lateness(empId, moveHour)
-calculate_lateness(targetHour, moveHour, distance, velocity) (static method)
-Class Variables & Methods:
-employeesNum â€” total employees
-change_emps_num(num) â€” modify employee count

ðŸ§ª Required Functionality / Testing:
 simulate a real-life story:

1-Samy is an employee with a Fiat 128 car.
2-He works at ITI Smart Village (an Office object).
3-He drives 20 km daily.
4-He must arrive before 9:00 AM, otherwise, he's marked as late.
5-Based on his arrival, either a reward or deduction is applied.
6-The Car consumes 10% fuel for each 10 km.
