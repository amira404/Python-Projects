🌟 Pyramid Pattern Generator
This Python project contains two simple functions that print star-based pyramid patterns based on user input. 
It's designed for learning purposes and demonstrates how to separate functionality into reusable modules.

🔧 Features
Print a right-aligned triangle pattern.
Print a simple pyramid pattern.
Organized using functions and a main control section.
Modular design, easy to extend with more patterns.
📁 Files
pyramids.py: Contains the functions to generate the patterns.
main.py: Provides a simple interface to choose and run a pattern.
▶️ Usage
Run main.py and choose which pattern to print by entering 1 or 2 when prompted.
